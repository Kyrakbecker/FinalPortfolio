                 Week 4
                 <br>
                 <img src="applab.png" height='350' width='225'/>
                 <img src="gamelab.png" height='350' width='225'/>
                 <br>
                 Week 4 was a fun week, I really enjoyed making these apps on code.org. I made a game where a player runs from a zombie and then an app thats a decision game.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Week 5
                 <br>
                 <img src="hw5.png" height='350' width='400'/>
                 <br>
                 I enjoyed this weeks work as well, I made a story of this gang of fish and then a shark that runs into them.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 For Week 6 I created the homepage, short story page, and contact us page for this website.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 For Week 7 I added more external style sheets and images to this website.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 For Week 8 I added the simple math game to this website.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Week 9
                 <br>
                 <img src="portrait.png" height='350' width='400'/>
                 <br>
                 This week we used html and p5.js to create shapes and a portrait on an HTML page.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 For Week 10 we made moving shapes on our self portrait.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Week 11
                 <br>
                 <img src="wk.png" height='350' width='400'/>
                 <br>
                 For week 11 we greated a player that can be moved with the keyboard, and exit, and moving obstacles.
                 <br>
                 Week 12
                 <br>
                 <img src="wk12.png" height='350' width='400'/>
                 <br>
                 We made some changes and used functions.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Week 13
                 <br>
                 <img src="wk13.png" height='350' width='400'/>
                 <br>
                 Lastly in week 13 we used arrays to create the same player, exit, and moving shapes.
                 <br>
